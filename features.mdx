## Project Organization and Folders

Organize your documentation projects using a flexible folder system. Create nested folders to group related pages, such as API references, user guides, and release notes. Bragly supports drag-and-drop reorganization, making it easy to maintain a logical structure as your project grows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root and select **New Folder**. Name it descriptively, like `API Reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-text">
    Inside the folder, create new pages or move existing ones. Use the sidebar for quick navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder Content" icon="move">
    Drag folders and pages to rearrange. Nested structures support up to 10 levels deep.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions, like prefixing with numbers (`01-Getting-Started`), to enforce order.
</Callout>

## Collaboration and Permissions

Invite team members to collaborate on documentation. Bragly offers role-based permissions: Viewer (read-only), Editor (edit content), Admin (manage users and settings). Assign permissions at the workspace, folder, or page level for precise control.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Workspace Permissions" icon="globe">
    Set global access for all content.
    
    | Role   | Can View | Can Edit | Manage Users |
    |--------|----------|----------|--------------|
    | Viewer | ✅       | ❌       | ❌           |
    | Editor | ✅       | ✅       | ❌           |
    | Admin  | ✅       | ✅       | ✅           |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Folder Permissions" icon="folder">
    Override workspace settings per folder. Ideal for restricting sensitive docs like internal APIs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version History and Editing

Every edit creates a new version, allowing you to track changes, revert mistakes, and review contributions. Use the visual diff viewer to compare versions side-by-side. Real-time editing supports multiple users without conflicts via operational transformation.

<Expandable title="Advanced Editing Features" default-open="false">
  - **Rich Text Editor**: Supports Markdown, embeds, and code blocks.
  - **Comments**: Inline feedback on specific sections.
  - **Export Versions**: Download as PDF or Markdown.
</Expandable>

Here's an example of fetching version history via API:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/project/versions', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` }
  });
  const versions = await response.json();
  console.log(versions);
  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  response = requests.get(
      'https://api.example.com/docs/project/versions',
      headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'}
  )
  versions = response.json()
  print(versions)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Search and Content Discovery

Bragly's search indexes all content in real-time, including full-text, titles, and tags. Filter results by folder, author, or date. Advanced discovery features include related content suggestions and saved searches.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Full-Text Index]
    B --> C[Filter by Folder/Author]
    C --> D[Results + Suggestions]
    D --> E[User]
```

<Callout kind="info">
  Pro tip: Tag pages with keywords like `api`, `tutorial` to improve discovery.
</Callout>

These features work together to streamline your documentation workflow. Start by organizing a sample project, then invite collaborators to see permissions in action.
